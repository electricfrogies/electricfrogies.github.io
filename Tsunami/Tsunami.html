<p id = "p1">Hi there! I'm Tsunami, and I like to build robots. I also like to computer program!<br>
I build robots with my family and my <strong>super cool</strong> Aunt Kelly, Uncle Adam, Beach Kitty, and Jedi J.<br>
I like to make webpages, and we made this one using Github. <a href = "https://hannahbananabutt.github.io/Home">I also made this one with Github.</a><br>
I hope you like the Electricfrogies robotics team website!<br>
Now, let me tell you a little more about myself.

<h2>Computer Programming</h2>
<p>I love computer programming. Computer programming has become a huge part of my life.<br>
I know Javascript, HTML, C, SQL (Sequel), and CSS. It sounds really hard, but it really isn't.<br>
I have used HTML and CSS to make this page. I learned HTML, CSS, and JS using Khan Academy.<br>
I have lots of JS programs <a href = "https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/HannahBananaButt/projects">right here</a> on Khan Academy.<br>
<br>
This page might be all mine, but I am building the whole website with my cousins and aunt!

<h2>Karate</h2>
<p>I do karate, too! It's fun!<br>
My brother, Duder Head, also does Karate. Karate is fun because you can learn so many moves!<br>
I'm learning how to use a bow now, as well as a sai! A bow is just a big stick, a little taller than I am,<br>
and I learn katas and cool moves with it. The sai is another weapon, but this one looks like a tiny little pitchfork. It's fun.<br>
I'm a purple belt right now (or when I typed this I was), and I have a lot of fun with it.<br>
Here's a pic of me doing karate (at home):

<h2>Our Cute, Fuzzy Cat</h2>
<p>
We have a really cute cat named Star. We got her from Chico's Pet Depot, where she always stayed in a tiny cage.<br>
Here's the story of how we got her:<br>
One night, Mom and Dad were in their room at Dad's desk, discussing if we should get a cat, and if so, what cat to get.<br>
I didn't know what they were discussing, however. So the next day, (Saturday) when we went to Chico's Pet Depot, I thought it wsa just for fun.<br>
But when Mom and Dad asked to se the adoption cats, I started to get excited. And then they told me. If we liked this grey cat named Star, we might get her.<br>
Star was a young, playful cat who liked to be up high. We played with her using the peacock feather, and she was purrfect.<br>
That Wenesday, we came and picked up that cute cat, Star. The workers at the pet shop said that Star liked to be up high, so we ordered her a really tall catstand that Star still loves today.<br>
We love her like crazy now, and did. She's gone almost everywhere with us. Now, she's a real family member!<br>
 She loves to curl around my neck while I sleep and purr until I fall asleep. <br>

  <h2>Robots</h2>
  <p>Ok, this <i>is</i> a robotics website, so I should probably tell you about my robots.<br>
  We (The Electric Frogies) LOVE to do competitions. We only last year moved near each other, but we definitely made the most of it.<br>
  We did two competitions. The first was the Space Elevator competition. We did LEGO, like almost all of our robots before.<br>
   The robot we built climbed up caution tape that was 23 ft high! The second competition was FLL, another LEGO contest. <br>
   It was fun! We had our robot do a lot of fun missions on a really cool mat. We did a presentation about subirrigation,<br>
   since the theme was water, and we did a fun team building excersize. Now, we're doing the Space Elevator again,<br>
   but this time we're using Arduino, programming it with C. We're building a lot of fun arduino projects along the way.<br>
