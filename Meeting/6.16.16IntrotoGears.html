<p><b>1. Describe how the relative size of the gears on a crank and a wheel in a gear train determine performance</b><br />
Gear Ratio > 1(small to big)<br />
Decreased speed, increased torque- easier uphill<br />
Gear Ratio < 1=(big to small)<br />
Increased speed, decreased torque<br />

<b>2. Relate the gear train behavior to the example of a bicycle on a hill<br />

<b>What are gears useful for? <br />
Making robots move faster, changing direction, increasing torque<br />
<b>What is a gear train? A series of gears working together<br /><p>
