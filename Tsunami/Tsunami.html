<p>I'm Tsunami, and I like to build robots. I also like to computer program!<br>
Our family has a really cute cat named Star. (She brings in way too many cicadas though...)<br>
Back to the topic here, I build robots with my family and my <strong>cool</strong> Aunt Kelly, Beach Kitty, and Jedi J.<br>
I like to make webpages, and we made this one using Github. <a href = "https://hannahbananabutt.github.io/Home">I also made this one with Github.</a><br>
I hope you like the Electricfrogies robotics team website!
