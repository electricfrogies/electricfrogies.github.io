<h1 text-align:center;>Robots we've Built</h1>
<p>This robot is out pizza deliverer bot, but we use it for other things, too.<br>
We built and programmed this robot <b>without</b> instructions, but some design help from Mom.<br>
It was first designed so that we had to make a ramp for it to go from the counter-part of the kitchen-dining-room<br>
to the table part. But we decided that our table was too small, and that we had to make too steep of a ramp for it to not fal off the edge.<br><iframe id = "pizza-bot-video" width="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L4MEwvpvNIU" frameborder="2"></iframe>
So we made it so that there was an elavated platform that went over the counter, but the wheels could stay on the ground.<br>
It was too big/too wobbly, so we took it and took out our middle part.<br>
It worked! We had made a robot that would deliver us pizza!<br>
We made dinner and it served us pizza!!!
