<h2>Robots I've made</h2>
One of the first robots I have designed was an amusement park.<br />
I made a ferris wheel and helped with a cable car. I also made<br />
a spinny car thingy (that needed tape). And yes, I also made <br />
the Amazing, Wonderful "Confused Road Sign!" (Applause please)<br />
So many people have taken pictures with it and showered it with<br />
love, that I hope you do too.<br />
