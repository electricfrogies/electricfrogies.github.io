<h1>Ev3 in Relation to the Computer</h1>
<h3>1. Identify the different parts of the EV3 computer</h3>
<p>A computer has four parts,, and they are:<br>
Input, Output, Processor, and Storage.
In the E<sub>v</sub>3, the input is the sensors,
the output is what the robot does based on the input,
the processor is the programmable brick,
and the storage is the memory chips inside the brick.
Which brings us to our next question.

</p>
<br>
<h3>2. Describe the role of the different types of memory chips in the EV3 computer</h3>
<p>There's RAM and FLASH memory in the EV3 brick.<br>
RAM stands for Random Access Memory. FLASH is discs that actually spin.<br>
Flash is used for all memory <i>except</i> the memory used when actually running the program.<br>
RAM is used only when the program is running.
