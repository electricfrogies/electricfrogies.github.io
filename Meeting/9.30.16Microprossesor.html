  <b>What is a microprocessor</b><br>
an integrated circuit that contains all the functions of a central processing unit of a computer.<br>
A litte city with skyscrapers, where circuits go over and under one another.<br> 
A transistor is a semiconductor device used to amplify or switch electronic signals and electrical power. It is composed of semiconductor material usually with at least three terminals for connection to an external circuit.<br>

<p class="magenta">
<b>1. List the four steps in the computer chip design process</b><br>
    1. architectural design stage- designs features (ex- how tall? elevators? etc)<br>
   2. Logic design- builers who use what the architects design to put blocks together<br>
   3. Circuit design- build physical circuits to connect transistors<br>
    4. Mask design- run simulations<br>
  <b>2. Explain the extreme environment necessary to make computer chips</b><br>
    Clean rooms (1000 times cleaner than hospital surgical room!), 40 steps to suit up, Even breath can contaminate chips because the chips are so small<br>
<b>3. Describe how masks are used to create each layer of computer chips <b/><br>
<p class="blue">
    1. lay down a material- either a conductor or insulator<br>
    2. Add photo resist chemical<br>
    3. Add mask that contains images of the circuits<br>
    4. Expose it to light, which exposes the photoresist<br>
    5. Etch the photoresist away to get the pattern needed<br>
They have to carve the pattern out instead depositing it onto the wafer<br>
    6. Add chemicals to get the properties they want <br>
