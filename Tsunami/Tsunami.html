<p id = "p1">I'm Tsunami, and I like to build robots. I also like to computer program!<br>
Our family has a really cute cat named Star. (She brings in way too many cicadas though...)<br>
Back to the topic here, I build robots with my family and my <strong>cool</strong> Aunt Kelly, Beach Kitty, and Jedi J.<br>
I like to make webpages, and we made this one using Github. <a href = "https://hannahbananabutt.github.io/Home">I also made this one with Github.</a><br>
I hope you like the Electricfrogies robotics team website!

<h2>Computer Programming</h2>
<p>I love computer programming. Computer programming has become a huge part of my life.<br>
I know Javascript, HTML, and CSS. It sounds really hard, but it really isn't.<br>
I have used HTML and CSS to make this page. I learned HTML, CSS, and JS using Khan Academy.<br>
I have lots of JS programs <a href = "https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/HannahBananaButt/projects">right here</a> on Khan Academy.<br>
My mom really likes to think about the aspects of joy, and so she wanted to make a website with me. We did, I wrote the code, and mom wrote the stories,<br>
and together, we're making <a href = "https://hannahbananabutt.github.io/Mom/Joy-Home">this.</a> it's really cool to be making a website with her.<br
This webpage might be all mine, but I am building it with my cousins and aunt!

<h2>Karate</h2>
<p>I do karate, and I do lots of cool moves such as: Side Blade Kick, Front Ball Kick, Back Kick, <br>
Spearhand, Shutoh, Front to Knuckle Punch, Back to Knuckle Punch, Thrust Punch, and Hammer Strikes.<br>
My brother, Duder Head, also does Karate. Karate is fun because you can actually get <b>better</b> at it.<br>
Here's a pic of me doing karate:
