Back to the topic here, I build robots with my family and my <strong>cool</strong> Aunt Kelly, Beach Kitty, and Jedi J.<br>
I like to make webpages, and we made this one using Github. <a href = "https://hannahbananabutt.github.io/Home">I also made this one with Github.</a><br>

<h2>Computer Programming</h2>
<p>I love computer programming. Computer programming has become a huge part of my life.<br>
I know Javascript, HTML, and CSS. It sounds really hard, but it really isn't.<br>
I have used HTML and CSS to make this page. I learned HTML, CSS, and JS using Khan Academy.<br>
I have lots of JS programs <a href = "https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/HannahBananaButt/projects">right here</a> on Khan Academy.<br>
My mom really likes to think about the aspects of joy, and so she wanted to make a website with me. We did, I wrote the code, and mom wrote the stories,<br>
and together, we're making <a href = "https://hannahbananabutt.github.io/Mom/Joy-Home">this.</a> it's really cool to be making a website with her.<br
This webpage might be all mine, but I am building the whole website with my cousins and aunt!

<h2>Karate</h2>
<p>I do karate, and I do lots of cool moves such as: Side Blade Kick, Front Ball Kick, Back Kick, <br>
Spearhand, Shutoh, Front to Knuckle Punch, Back to Knuckle Punch, Thrust Punch, and Hammer Strikes.<br>
My brother, Duder Head, also does Karate. Karate is fun because you can actually get <b>better</b> at it.<br>
Here's a pic of me doing karate:

<h2>Our Cute Cat</h2>
<p>
We have a really cute cat named Star. We got her from Chico's Pet Depot, where she always stayed in a tiny cage.<br>
Here's the story of how we got her:<br>
One night, Mom and Dad were in their room at Dad's desk, discussing if we should get a cat, and if so, what cat to get.<br>
I didn't know what they were discussing, however. So the next day, (Saturday) when we went to Chico's Pet Depot, I thought it wsa just for fun.<br>
But when Mom and Dad asked to se the adoption cats, I started to get excited. And then they told me. If we liked this grey cat named Star, we might get her.<br>
Star was a young, playful cat who liked to be up high. We played with her using the peacock feather, and she was purrfect.<br>
That Wenesday, we came and picked up that cute cat, Star. The workers at the pet shop said that Star liked to be up high, so we ordered her a really tall catstand that Star still loves today.<br>
We love her like crazy now, and did. She's gone almost everywhere with us. Now, she's a real family member!
